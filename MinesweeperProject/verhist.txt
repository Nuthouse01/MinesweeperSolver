v1.0: It works!!! 2 single-cell solver strategies and 3 multi-cell solver strategies, supports random-guessing or
		always-succeed guessing (to get to the endgame more reliably)
v1.1: Improved stat-tracking and printouts in too many ways to mention
v1.2: Fixed a stupid bug in nonoverlap-safe and nonoverlap-flag that prevented them from being applied at all
v1.3: Allowed for nonoverlap-safe to be applied multiple times sequentially to the same cell 
v1.4: Restructured 121-line strategy into 121-cross, because it failed a few times. Hasn't failed since the change
v1.5: Changed multi-cell logic from making only one pass to the "loop until nothing is changed" paradigm

v2.0: Added "smartguess" feature, calculates the % risk in each of the "border cells" (where visible
		adjacency cells give some information about the unknown cells' contents) and in the "interior
		cells" (where I have no information), then chooses a cell with the lowest risk.
		Sadly this algorithm is HIDEOUSLY inefficient and increases runtime by a factor of 120x (not 120%)
v2.1: MASSIVE time improvement in smartguess algorithm, by adding a number of shortcuts and limits. Time gap reduced
		to 4x - 8x
		A) shortcut: when all remaining border cells each satisfy only one adjacency cell, then don't even
		   recurse, just return the sum of their adjacency values (because at this point the order has no effect
		   on the number of mines placed). Massive improvements in early/midgame when there are "islands" of revealed
		   cells in a "sea" of unknowns, mild improvement in lategame. No loss of accuracy.
		B) width-limit: at each level (except for the initial entry-point) it only tries 2 (configurable)
		   of the unk cells tied for max size as start points for recursion, instead of all. Reduces accuracy somewhat.
		C) depth-limit: after recursing down 8 (configurable) layers of recursion, AKA placing 8 mines, it
		   stops branching at all and sets the width-limit to 1. Reduces accuracy somewhat.
v2.2: Changed recursive algorithm finding minimum allocation of border mines to instead find
		the MAXIMUM allocation when starting at the most "crowded" cells; a sorta compromise/split,
		finding the maximum of the minimum allocation or something. I don't understand why it works
		better, but it more closely approximates the true number of mines in the border cells. Slight success
		improvement, I forget the number :(
		(Old avg deviation approx -0.4, new avg deviation approx -0.29)
		Also prints the avg deviation number, because I can.
v2.3: Changed border-cell risk calculation to use average of all possibilities instead of max, slight
		success improvement (30.8% -> 31.7% over 3k games) 

v3.0: Changed some ways variables/data are stored (unimportant)
		Compiled it in "release" mode, preparing for post on Facebook
		   MAJOR NOTE: when compiled in "release" mode it goes approx. 100x faster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Average game
		   time is down below 10ms!!!!!!!! When using SCREEN_def=0, average game time down below 2ms!!!!!!!
		Increased resolution of 'elapsed time' to account for going so much faster
		Added minimum delay of 1ms to each game, just in case, to guarantee each game has a unique seed
		Added command-line args, interactive prompting for settings, #defines now only set the default values
		Also removed some of what's printed to screen on SCREEN_def=1, now its only end-game status and summary
		The field is printed to log at each stage only when SCREEN_def=1/2, but transition map & stats are always printed to log
v3.1: To better support "double-click from windows explorer", after failing to parse it will pause instead of closing terminal
		Added 'comb' function for use in podwise-recursion (next version)
		A few other misc improvements
v4.0: New and improved recursive algorithm method! IT WORKS! Still needs some tweaking and refinement, tho
		Modified the comb function
		Modified 'reveal' function to just set the cell state to SATISFIED when revealing a 0
v4.1: Podwise-recursion returns a list of all the possible allocation numbers(so I can average them), instead of just max and min 
		Bugfix: if # of mines remaining = # of unknown cells remaining, flag them and win!
		Bugfix: forgot to multiply interior_risk by 100
		Redid structure of hunting/guessing section to reduce redundant code
		Changed 'always succeed' option to instead be 'pick zeroes until some logic is applied',
v4.2: Removed the old smartguess code, new version gives comparable results but vastly superior speed
v4.3: Changed the podwise_return::avg to discard anything bigger than the ceiling instead of concatting
		NOTE: this is a potential source of error in the future, if I put in limiters and don't find all possible allocs
		Added function:comb_int and function:factorial (currently unused)
		Removed even more old smartguess code I missed, modified some unlikely or impossible assert() statements, and deleted 
			some commented code I'm not ever bringing back
		Restructured steps 3b/3c in podwise recursion, hopefully solves the dupes problem, undershoot problem, and looping problem
		Actually compared v3.0 with v4.3 side-by-side... over 10k games without any printing, new algorithm reduced avg game time 
			from 0.0046 sec -> 0.0023 sec, and increased winrate from 31.3% -> 32.6%. Expect that the winrate still has +/- 1% wiggle,
			even over 10k games, so they should be considered about the same winrate. Also the prediction deviation changed from 
			-0.2957 -> +0.1261, I think negative would be preferrable to positive but the absolute deviation is much less.
		Added version printout, just cuz I can
v4.4: Added safety limiter on the recursion, shouldn't be used very often at all. 
		NOTE: do I want avg to return 0 or mines_remaining if there are no valid entries?
v4.5: Massive restructuring of the podwise_return object and the find_allocations function (now find_scenarios)
		Preparation for logic to let it see and apply solutions to the game in the final stages
		Requires knowing that there is only one way to allocate the cells to produce a given solution... that allocation info
			can be used to do a weighted avg instead of an unweighted avg
		human-guess deviation jumped from +0.13 to +0.16 ??????
		zguess deviation jumped from +0.36 to +0.50 ?????? it should be better, not worse!! 
			(winrate is unchanged, 58% +/- 0.3% with zguess)
v4.6: Implemented the end-game solver logic: when # of mines remaining is below a certain threshold, smartguess will store the actual
			allocation found for each solution #. If there is only one allocation possible, it might be applied directly instead of
			making a risky choice. Specifically, this changes winrate in an 'elbow' scenario from 33% to 100%, but has application 
			in other situations too.
		zguess winrate jumped from 58% to 59%, much less than I was hoping for
		Also the smartguess deviation jumped again, as a result of not counting the deviation # when applying a solution
		Bugfix: removed smartguess step 1b, was a bad idea, what was I even thinking
		Added new transition map key, A = advanced logic = whatever comes out of smartguess that isn't an actual guess
		Revealed several new bugs related to looping-problem
		Revealed bug: will only return parts of an "exact answer" that are links, needs to return the whole thing
v4.7: Hopefully fixed looping-problem, now algorithm will (hopefully) always return a sensible answer
		Improved stat tracking when smartguess loses
		Added printout for average # of guesses per game (not counting initial blind guess)
		Fixed the "exact answer" incompleteness... increased memory usage (as expected) but speed is unchanged

v4.8: Minor tweaks to comments
		Changed reveal() so it also counts the zero-cells
		Changed SC, MC so trans-map entries are the # of cells flaged/cleared, not the # of times applied
		Finally removed the hunting-guessing distinction
		Added trans-map entries for random-guessing and zero-guessing (r and z), ^ is now for smartguess specifically
		Changed the run-end stats to display (0-15)(15-85)(85-100) in terms of completion when it loses
		Changed random seeding to use <random> library instead of sequential values from time; removes 1ms floor
		Changed CHAIN_RECHECK_COUNTER to count up instead of down (functionally the same)
		
v4.9: Logs go to LOGS folder, creates the folder if its not there already
		Removed stdafx.h and other precompiled header nonsense (finally)
		Added .gitignore thing
		Removed unused gamestate tracker variable and enum definition
		Implemented privacy in the 'cell' struct
		Changed myprintfn variadic-function-macro to just be a variadic-function
		Created 'basegame' file
		Created 'solver' and 'settings' files
		Created 'stats' file
		Slightly changed how some 'globals' are initialized
		
v4.10: 	Implemented game-loss histogram! Hid redundant stats as a result (still calculated, not displayed)
		CLEANUP: Reduced #includes to only what's necessary where its necessary
		CLEANUP: Made single-cell logic into a function, created new convention/standard for the logic/rule functions
		CLEANUP: Refined the multi-cell logic functions, fits the new convention
		Implemented 'queueing' strategy for two-cell, determined it doesn't offer any improvement, and reverted to in-place strategy
		CLEANUP: Moved rand_from_list to basegame, wanted to templatize but turns out I don't need to
		CLEANUP: Renamed find_nonoverlap to extract_overlap and moved to basegame
		CLEANUP: Smartguess accumulates stats into game_stats, so nothing changes run_stats until the end-of-game
		CLEANUP: Split "advanced solving/chain optimization" into its own function, returns chain and handles cells internally if needed
		Added 2-way NOV-flag, and 3-way NOV-flag and NOV-safe to the "chain optimization" stage
			Winrate, solve time, and recursion overflows are all utterly unchanged :(
			Turns out that 121 logic can't be safely applied to the chain
		Implemented a 'luck/safety' tracker, display average safety of each guess (including initial)
			Massive disparity between actual winrate vs winrate derived from avg luck per guess and avg # guesses...
			Probably due to smartguess not calculating risks perfectly? Might be resolved if 'perfect' mode is implemented
		Made a little bit of 'runinfo' private, added setting/access functions
		Renamed 'multi-cell logic' to 'two-cell logic' and renamed the chain build/optimize to 'multi-cell logic'
			TODO: probably have to make even more changes in readme.txt
		CLEANUP: moved the flagging/clearing bit inside the smartguess function
		CLEANUP: changed riskholder to use a 3d array instead of a 2d array of special structs
		CLEANUP: replaced some unneccessary structs with tuples
		
v4.11:	Begin trying to improve the smartguess method, will move to v5.0 when new method is done
		Finally decided that using frontpod in smartguess recursion is the correct strategy
		Smartguess recursion takes pointer to chain instead of actual chain; less mem on stack
		Replaced most comparisons with the "endsolver threshold" with a boolean that is set once
		Removed the "chain recheck" section
		(git push)
		Built infrastructure and functions needed for 'perfectmode'
		Implemented 'perfectmode' in recursive function (TODO: DEBUG AND VERIFY)
		(git push)
		Turned endsolver section into its own function and greatly improved it
		Began adding support for "aggregate info" to operate without the 'outof' member
		(git push)
		Possibly fixed 
		
		
TODO:
*re-test and probably eliminate "chain recheck depth" feature

*3 guess options: 
		dumb(random), 
		smart(current: recurse to estimate border/interior count, find border risk via contributing pods(max?avg?), but use endsolver below a threshold),
		perfect(thorough, try all scenarios and see how many scenarios place a flag in each border cell, possibly revert to "smart" if it gets out of control)
		
*NOTE: different purposes/uses: endsolver cares about how many mines remain, perfect does not
		if near the end, returning each allocation to see if there is a minimum/maximum solution, but if there is a non-discrete minimum/maximum 
			solution then I may get a partial solution from their commonalities/overlap
		when in the middle, not looking for a specific solution, just for the overall risk % (may reduce memory usage by returning/combining lists of 
			risks rather than solutions/allocations)
		perhaps below a threshold, both smart->endsolver and perfect->endsolver ?
		
		
		
	endsolver: (usually doesn't find any conclusive answer)
		note: perhaps it should be used when interior_list is small or near-empty? and should be disabled when the overflow valve is triggered
		if near the end, recursion returns more info
			recurse to find discrete allocations to satisfy each chain
		if near the end, use this extra info
			check if any combinations of discreet answers fit (eliminate any that don't fit?)
			if nothing works, continue with smartguess or perfectmode
		
	smartguess:
		if interior_list is not empty, run recursion
			recurse to find most likely allocation number for each chain
			find interior_cell risk
		find border_cell risk via contributing pods
		guess
		
	perfectmode:
		always run recursion
			recurse to find most likely allocation number for each chain
			also store status of each cell in aggregate, clear/flag
			find interior_cell risk same as smartguess, if there is any interior_cell
		know border_cell risk from recursion statistics
		might find definite clear/flag cells (not caught in optimization stage)
		if not, guess
